### About escrow
Escrow can be used to hold funds of a buyer before they are transfered to a seller. First, buyer's funds are transfered to escrow. Then, items have to be delivered successfully to buyer so seller can receive the funds from the escrow. (read more about escrow [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrow.asp))
